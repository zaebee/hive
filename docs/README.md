## 🧬 Quick Reference

### The Sacred ATCG Code

```python
# The Four Fundamental Primitives
class HiveDNA:
    A = "Aggregate"     # 🫀 Business logic organs
    T = "Transformation" # ⚗️ Pure processing enzymes  
    C = "Connector"     # 🌉 External world bridges
    G = "Genesis Event" # 📢 System memory & communication
```

### The Five Sacred Codons

| Pattern | Flow | Purpose | Example |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| **C→A→G** | Connector → Aggregate → Genesis | Command Processing | REST API → Order → OrderPlaced |
| **C→T→C** | Connector → Transformation → Connector | Data Pipeline | DB → PriceCalc → Cache |
| **G→C→A→G** | Genesis → Connector → Aggregate → Genesis | Event Reaction | OrderPlaced → PaymentAPI → Payment → PaymentProcessed |
| **G→C→A→C** | Genesis → Connector → Aggregate → Connector | Event to Output | OrderPlaced → EmailAPI → Notification → EmailService |
| **Choreography** | Multiple Genesis Events | Complex Workflow | Order fulfillment across multiple hives |

### Chemical Bonds
